\begin{abstract}
  This paper analyzes a Named Entity Recognition task for South-Slavic languages using the pre-trained multilingual neural network models.
  Observing the performance metrics from prior research showed that the performance of the fine-tuned multilingual neural model is very close to the performance of the monolingual one.
  This observation leads us to a question that this paper aims to answer: Can the fine-tuning of multilingual pre-trained embeddings, other than the target language corpora, improve named entity recognition for a specific language?
  We show that the model performance is not influenced substantially, especially if the target language has rich Named Entity training corpora.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Multilingual neural models simplify scalability and applications where many languages are needed for the NLP task.
Getting the performance of a multilingual neural model as close as possible to the performance of a monolingual one can be very beneficial.
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is also one of the cornerstones of the Natural Language Processing (NPL) tasks in many text processing systems.

We observed two prior works:
\begin{itemize}
\item BSNLP: 3rd Shared Task on SlavNER~\cite{piskorski-etal-2021-slav} submitted paper by Prelevikj and Žitnik et al.~\cite{prelevikj-zitnik-2021-multilingual}
\item Clipping industry project developed by the Department of Knowledge Technologies at Jožef Stefan Institute~\cite{KTIJS}
\end{itemize}
The prior work mentioned above has shown that the monolingual NER model performance for the Slovene language is practically equal to that of a multilingual one.
Additionally, the Clipping industry project multilingual model was fine-tuned with other language corpora from the same - South-Slavic family.

The question that naturally arises from prior work and this paper tries to answer is this: Did the fine-tuning with related languages influence the performance of a multilingual model?
The problem with comparing both prior works is that the: corpus preprocessing, pre-trained models, hyper-parameters, performance measures were different in both experiments, so one has to be cautious when evaluating the performance metrics or deriving conclusions from them.

First, we present the corpora we used and how we preprocessed them, followed by their analysis.
Next, we continue with a method where we first introduce the measures, models, hyper-parameters, and software used.
Finally, we finish this paper by evaluating the results and presenting conclusions.

\section{Data Description}
\label{sec:data-description}
We used the most common and established NER corpora for selected languages (see Table~\ref{tab:corpora}).
The assumption and strategy for gathering corpora were also: ``the more, the better.''
\begin{table}[H]
  \caption{List of Used Corpora}

  \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
We used NER tags in IOB2~\cite{IOB2} format from the CoNLL-2003 shared task~\cite{CoNLL2003} as a common denominator for all corpora and experiments.
Each corpus was first combined if split, then converted to a common format, reshuffled, and split to train/dev/test set in an 80/10/10 ratio.

We produced combined corpora by concatenating the sets without further reshuffling so that the experiments could be repeated.

The Slovene corpora were obtained from BSNLP and parts of a newly published combined Training corpus {SUK} 1.0~\cite{SUK-1.0}
%Prepared and converted data is available on Github for convenience and possible manual review (move to online resources?).

\subsection{Data Conversion}
\label{subsec:data-conversion}
The first obstacle was the different NER tags used in corpora.
We decided to keep only common tags: PER, LOC, and ORG\@.
For example, the BSNLP corpus uses PRO and EVT tags, while the WikiANN corpus lacks a MISC tag common to ssj500k and hr500k training corpora.
All non-common tags, including MISC, were replaced with O (outside IOB).

The second obstacle was the difference in format.
BSNLP corpus, for instance, uses separate files for verbatim text and NER tags, with no positional reference between one another.
We used CLASSLA~\cite{ljubesic-dobrovoljc-2019-neural} sentence segmentation and tokenization with a custom conversion script to solve this problem.

The third step was to remove sentences longer than 128 tokens and convert corpora from standard CoNLL format to CSV format with two fields:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sentence: whitespace separated sentence word tokens.
  \item NER: white space separated NER tags for each sentence word token.
\end{itemize}

The fourth and final step was splitting the corpus data into train, test, and dev sets.

\subsection{Corpora analysis}
\label{subsec:corpora-analysis}
Comparing the corpora showed the differences that could potentially be problematic for obtaining aligned model performance.
Especially considering the NER tag ratios where the WikiANN automatically annotated corpora structure was standing
out (see Table~\ref{tab:corpora_analysis} and Figure~\ref{fig:corpora_analysis}).
\begin{table}[H]

Fortunately, we were unable to detect any inconsistencies regarding performance measurements.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Measurements}
\label{subsec:measurements}
For the classification measurements, the Seqeval library~\cite{seqeval} was used.
Although the library uses CoNLL evaluation by default, we chose ``strict'' mode evaluation.
When calculating measurements, the strict mode also considers the IOB tag's ``beginning'' and ``inside'' parts.
Therefore the NER tags must match exactly.

\subsection{Model selection}
\label{subsec:model-selection}
We used the Hugging Face's transformers Python library~\cite{wolf-etal-2020-transformers} for all the experiments.
Prior work used two pre-trained multilingual models from Hugging Face (among others), which produced the best results:
\begin{itemize}
  \item BERT multilingual base model (cased)~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-04805}
  \item XLM-RoBERTa (base sized model)~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1911-02116}
\end{itemize}

Due to the task and resource limitations, we continued with our experiments using only XLM-RoBERTa base sized model,
since the initial baseline tests showed that XLM-RoBERTa consistently outperforms the BERT model (see Table~\ref{tab:roberta_vs_bert})

\begin{table}[H]
  \caption{XLM-RoBERTa vs. BERT multilingual cased}
  \label{tab:roberta_vs_bert}
  \begin{tabular}{llrrrr}
    \toprule
    Model&Corpora&Precision&Recall&F1&Accuracy\\
    \midrule
    mcbert&bsnlp&0.935&0.931&0.933&0.990\\
    xlmrb&bsnlp&0.947&0.954&\textbf{0.951}&0.993\\
    \midrule
    mcbert&ssj500k&0.826&0.828&0.827&0.984\\
    xlmrb&ssj500k&0.869&0.902&\textbf{0.885}&0.990\\
    \midrule
    mcbert&bsnlp+ssj500k&0.898&0.903&0.900&0.986\\
    xlmrb&bsnlp+ssj500k&0.929&0.931&\textbf{0.930}&0.990\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Parameters}
\label{subsec:parameters}
For all the experiments, we used the following hyper-parameters:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 256 max-length for tokenizer
  \item PyTorch's AdamW algorithm with 5e-5 learning rate
  \item batch size of 20
  \item 40 epochs
  \item F1 score for best model selection and training progression.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Method}
\label{subsec:method}
The selected method was first to train the baseline model for each language and produce NER classification measurements.
Baseline models were fine-tuned with only one - target language.
Next, we combined additional language corpora, re-train the model, and again measured performance against the target language test set.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
We used a target language test set for the evaluation and measured performance against the fine-tuned models.

The overall F1 score, used in the evaluation tables and figures, is a macro-averaged F1 score over all three NER tags.

Due to time and resource constraints, we excluded Bosnian and Macedonian language analysis.
Their corpora structure also influenced this decision, but we included them in evaluating other languages to see if something interesting would emerge.

The average distance from the baseline was used as a measure to show the overall variability of different models tested with the same test set.
\subsection{Slovene}
\label{subsec:slovene}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Slovene language test set model performance}
  \label{fig:eval_sl}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{eval_sl}
\end{figure}

The Slovene test set shows surprising model stability.
This stability comes, assumingly, from larger corpora compared to the others.
It might be that the quality of the corpora also plays a crucial role in this observation.

\begin{table}[H]
  \caption{Slovene language test set model performance}
  \label{tab:eval_sl}
  \begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}
    \toprule
    Model&PER F1&LOC F1&ORG F1&Overall F1\\
    \midrule
    baseline sl&0.963&0.963&0.931&0.952\\
    \midrule
    sl.sr&0.963&0.955&0.921&0.946\\
    sl.hr&0.962&0.96&0.924&0.948\\
    sl.hr.sr&0.964&0.958&0.925&0.949\\

    sl.hr.sr.bs.mk&0.962&0.952&0.926&0.947\\
    \midrule
    avg.\ dist.&0.00071&0.00695&0.00634&0.00433\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

If we observe the average distance from the baseline in the table's last row, we can see that it is only near 0.5\%.

\subsection{Croatian}
\label{subsec:croatian}

The Croatian language test set shows more significant variability when tested with different models.
We can observe the most significant variability on the ORG tag.
It might be that the other corpora training is influencing variability.
We can see that the average distance from the baseline is between 0.5\% and 1\%.

    avg.\ dist.&0.00757&0.00554&0.00977&0.00624\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Serbian}
\label{subsec:serbian}
The Serbian language test set is the only one that increased its performance measurements regarding its baseline.
Its average distance in performance measurements from the baseline is from approximately 0.5\% to 2.5\%.
The main suspect for this phenomenon is the Serbian corpora size.
It's the smallest included in this analysis and the most easily influenced by other corpora.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have shown that the model performance is not influenced substantially when trained with other than a target language.
This assumption seems true when we have enough training data for the target language.
Fine-tuning with other languages may benefit only the ``low resource'' languages.

Our initial assumption doesn't hold, but the result is still positive when we use the model in a multilingual setting.
When using a multilingual model in an application, the performance would not degrade much if we fine-tune the model with additional language corpora from the same family.
